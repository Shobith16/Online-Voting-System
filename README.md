### Database Setup Instructions

To access the database, follow these steps:

   Create a `.env` file in the backend folder and define the following variables:
   ```dotenv
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:XXXXX/Voting_System
   ```
   Replace `XXXXX` with your MongoDB port number.

3. **Install Backend Dependencies:**  
   Install the required dependencies for the backend by running:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. **Return to the Main Directory:**  
   Go back to the main directory using:
